## Core Features

### Patient Case Management
- **Case Submission**: Patients can submit medical cases with detailed descriptions, treatment cost estimates, and supporting documentation links
- **Unique Identifiers**: Each case receives a unique ID (e.g., "CASE0001") for easy reference and tracking
- **Case Lookup**: Efficient on-chain mechanism to retrieve case details using unique identifiers

### Advanced Verification System
- **Trusted Verifier Network**: Platform administrators maintain a network of authorized medical verifiers
- **Quorum-based Verification**: 70% of verifier votes required for case approval
- **Time-constrained Verification**: Verifiers must complete verification within 10 days
- **Admin Override**: Administrators can approve or reject cases after the 10-day verification window to prevent stalled cases
- **Rejection Management**: Ability to close rejected cases to maintain system cleanliness

### Secure Fund Management
- **Escrow System**: All donations are held in secure program-derived address (PDA) escrows
- **Multi-signature Authorization**: Fund release requires multiple authorizations (default: 3 signatures)
- **Dual-asset Support**: Accept both SOL and SPL token donations
- **Token Vaults**: Separate token vaults created for different SPL token donations
- **Treatment Facility Payments**: Direct disbursement to verified treatment facilities

### NFT Receipt System
- **Donation Verification**: NFT receipts provide immutable proof of contribution
- **Metadata-rich Tokens**: Includes details about donation amount, recipient case
- **Collection Hierarchy**: Organized in a collection for easy verification and tracking
- **URI-based Metadata**: Supports customizable metadata to enhance donor experience

### Event Tracking
- **On-chain Event Logging**: Comprehensive event system for tracking all actions
- **Transaction Verification**: Ability to verify all operations through blockchain explorers
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of case verification, donations, and fund releases

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Design
Built using the Anchor framework on Solana with a focus on security, efficiency, and scalability-

#### Account Structure
- **Administrator Account**: Controls platform operations, verifier management
- **Verifier Accounts**: Authorized entities that validate patient claims
- **Patient Case Accounts**: Stores patient information, funding goals, and verification status
- **Case Counter & Lookup**: Global counter and efficient lookup system for case ID management
- **Escrow Accounts**: Secure holding for donated funds with multisig release
- **Donor Accounts**: Tracks donations and enables NFT receipt issuance
- **Proposal Accounts**: Manages fund release proposals and approvals

#### Security Design
- **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**: Used for secure, deterministic account derivation
- **Bump Seed Management**: Properly manages PDA derivation to prevent collision attacks
- **Authority Checks**: Strict checks on account authorities and signers
- **Time-based Controls**: Enforces time windows for operations like verification

#### Core Features Implementation
- **Time-based Verification Window**: 
  ```rust
  // Only allow admin override after 10 days from submission
  let now = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
  require!(
      now >= patient_case.submission_time + ALLOWED_VERIFICATION_TIME as i64, 
      CuraChainError::VerifiersVerificationActive
  );
  ```

- **Verifier Quorum System**:
  ```rust
  // Check if yes votes is 70% of total votes
  let approval_threshold_70_scaled = total_votes_u32_scaled
      .checked_mul(70)
      .ok_or(CuraChainError::OverflowError)?
      .checked_div(100)
      .ok_or(CuraChainError::OverflowError)?;
  ```

- **Fund Management**:
  ```rust
  // Multisig requirement (default: 3 signers)
  pub const MULTISIG_THRESHOLD: u8 = 3;
  ```

## Verification System

CuraChain implements a sophisticated multi-level verification system:

### Verifier Network
1. **Verifier Registration**: Administrators add trusted medical verifiers to the platform
2. **Global Registry**: All authorized verifiers are tracked in a global registry
3. **Verifier Rotation**: Administrators can add or remove verifiers as needed

### Verification Process
1. **Case Submission**: Patient submits case with medical documentation
2. **Verifier Review**: Authorized verifiers review the case and vote (yes/no)
3. **Quorum Check**: System calculates if 70% of votes are positive
4. **Automated Verification**: Case automatically verified when quorum reached
5. **Escrow Creation**: Upon verification, system automatically creates donation escrow

### Admin Override Functionality
The platform includes a time-sensitive admin override capability:
1. **Time Window**: Verifiers have 10 days (864,000 seconds) to vote
2. **Verification Deadlock**: If verifiers don't respond within timeframe
3. **Admin Action**: Administrator can override and approve/reject case
4. **Escrow Management**: If approved, escrow is automatically created

## NFT System

CuraChain incorporates an innovative NFT-based donation receipt system:

### NFT Collection
1. **Master Collection**: Platform maintains a master NFT collection
2. **Collection Verification**: All donation NFTs are verified members of the collection
3. **Metadata Structure**: Standardized metadata format for all donation receipts

### Donor Experience
1. **First Donation**: First-time donors to a case receive an NFT receipt
2. **Metadata Storage**: NFT includes donation details and case information
3. **URI-based Metadata**: Supports rich metadata through customizable URIs
4. **Metadata Updates**: For repeat donors, metadata is updated with new donation information

### Implementation Details
```rust
// Create Metadata Account For First-time Donations
let data_v2 = DataV2 {
    name: format!("Recognition NFT -- {}", case_id),
    symbol: "CURA".to_string(),
    uri: nft_uri,
    seller_fee_basis_points: 0,
    creators: None,
    collection: Some(Collection {
        verified: false,
        key: ctx.accounts.parent_recognition_collection_nft.key(),
    }),
    uses: None
};
```

## Fund Management

### Donation Process
1. **Verified Cases Only**: System only allows donations to verified cases
2. **Multiple Asset Types**: Support for both SOL and SPL token donations
3. **Token Vaults**: Creation of specific vaults for each token type
4. **Donation Tracking**: All donations tracked on-chain with donor information
5. **Donation Limits**: Prevents over-funding of cases with configurable buffer

### Fund Release
1. **Proposal Creation**: Any multisig member can propose fund release
2. **Approval Process**: Requires approval from minimum threshold of members (default: 3)
3. **Execution**: Transfers funds directly to specified treatment facility
4. **SPL Handling**: Creates associated token accounts for treatment facility if needed
5. **Tracking**: All transfers are tracked with on-chain events

### Multisig Implementation
```rust
// AUTHORIZED MULTISIG TRANSFERS ACCUMULATED FUNDS TO TREATMENT WALLET 
pub fn release_funds<'info>(ctx: Context<'_, '_, '_, 'info, ReleaseFunds<'info>>, 
    case_id: String, proposal_index: u64) -> Result<()> {
    instructions::release_funds(ctx, case_id, proposal_index)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Detailed Process Flow Description:

1. **Platform Initialization**:
   - Administrator account is created with required permissions
   - Multisig authority established with configurable threshold (default: 3)
   - Global verifiers registry initialized to track authorized medical validators
   - Case counter PDA setup to generate sequential case IDs

2. **Patient Submission Flow**:
   - Patient submits medical case with documentation and funding goal
   - System assigns unique identifier (e.g., "CASE0001") through case counter
   - Patient case PDA created and linked to submitter's wallet
   - Submission timestamp recorded for verification deadline tracking

3. **Verification Process**:
   - Authorized verifiers review case documentation
   - Each verifier casts a single vote (yes/no) with duplicate prevention
   - System tracks verification statistics in patient case account
   - If 70% of verifiers approve, case is automatically verified
   - If insufficient votes after 10 days (864,000 seconds), admin can override
   - Admin override creates escrow if approved, or leaves case unverified if rejected

4. **Donation System**:
   - Donors can only contribute to verified cases
   - Support for both SOL and SPL token donations
   - First-time donors receive NFT receipts with case metadata
   - Repeat donors get updated NFT metadata reflecting total contributions
   - All NFTs are verified members of the CuraChain collection
   - Donation limits prevent over-funding with configurable buffer

5. **Fund Release Mechanism**:
   - Any multisig member can propose fund transfer to treatment facility
   - Required number of approvals (default: 3) must be reached
   - Proposal tracking ensures each member can only vote once
   - Fund transfer executes automatically when threshold reached
   - System handles both SOL and SPL token transfers to facility
   - Creates associated token accounts for facility as needed

This comprehensive flow ensures secure, transparent fund management with appropriate checks and balances throughout the medical crowdfunding process.
